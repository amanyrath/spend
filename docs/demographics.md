# Demographic Attributes for Representativeness

The synthetic users should mirror key U.S. population characteristics. For example, the median U.S. age is about 39 years[\[1\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#age#:~:text=39), with roughly 50.9% female and 49.1% male[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#:~:text=The%202020%20US%20Census%20reported,up%20slightly%20less%20of%20the). Households average ~2.5 persons[\[3\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#:~:text=131%2C332%2C360%20%C2%B1130%2C190%20Number%20of%20households). Income and wealth vary widely - per-capita income is about \\\$43.3K and median household income \\\$77.7K[\[4\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#age#:~:text=%2443%2C313%20%C2%B1%2491%20Per%20capita%20income), with ~12.5% of people below the poverty line[\[5\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#age#:~:text=Poverty). We should incorporate demographic distributions (from sources like the ACS or Census) such as:

- **Age and sex:** Include an age distribution (children, working-age, seniors) centered on ~39-40 years[\[1\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#age#:~:text=39), and roughly equal gender split (slightly more females).
- **Race/ethnicity:** Match U.S. racial makeup (e.g. ~61-62% White alone, ~13% Black, ~19% Hispanic/Latino, ~6% Asian, etc). (For context, in 2020 Whites were ~61.6% of the population[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#:~:text=now%20members%20of%20ethnic%20minority,33) and Hispanics ~18.7%[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#:~:text=Latino%20Americans%20%20accounted%20for,34%20%5D%20Immigrants).)
- **Household composition:** Vary household size (single, couples, families) with ~131 million households (avg. 2.5 people)[\[3\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#:~:text=131%2C332%2C360%20%C2%B1130%2C190%20Number%20of%20households). Include presence of children or elderly dependents as per census data.
- **Income/wealth:** Reflect income distribution (e.g. quintiles or census brackets). Use ACS data so that e.g. low-income households (<\\\$30K), middle-income (\\\$30-100K), and high-income segments mirror national shares.
- **Other socioeconomics:** If available, include education level, employment status, and home ownership vs. renting, since these correlate with spending.

## Transaction & Spending Features

Transactions should cover typical consumer categories and behaviors. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports average expenditure shares like: Housing ~32.9%, Transportation ~17.0%, Food ~12.9%, Insurance/Pensions ~12.4%, Healthcare ~8.0%, Entertainment ~4.7%, etc.[\[8\]](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cesan.pdf#:~:text=aggregate%20of%20the%20five%20smallest,0%20percent%20of%20total%20expenditures). Our synthetic data should similarly distribute spending across categories. Key transaction attributes to include:

- **Spending categories:** Use a realistic category taxonomy (e.g. Plaid's personal finance categories), including _Housing (rent/mortgage, utilities)_, _Food_ (groceries and dining), _Transport_ (gas, transit), _Health_, _Insurance/Pensions_, _Entertainment_ (streaming, media), _Apparel_, _Cash gifts/donations_, _Miscellaneous_, etc. Ensure category shares roughly match those in national data[\[8\]](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cesan.pdf#:~:text=aggregate%20of%20the%20five%20smallest,0%20percent%20of%20total%20expenditures).
- **Income transactions:** Model deposits (salaries, wages, pensions). Include regular paychecks (monthly/biweekly) and irregular income patterns. For example, one persona has irregular payrolls, so simulate "payroll_frequency" (regular vs. irregular) and measure "median_pay_gap" between deposits.
- **Recurring vs. one-off:** Flag recurring payments (utilities, subscriptions, insurance) vs. one-time purchases. About 70-80% of Americans pay multiple subscriptions; one report notes the average person spends ~\$219/month on subscriptions[\[9\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/experts-suggest-taking-stock-of-how-much-your-monthly-subscriptions-really-cost-before-the-end-of-the-year/#:~:text=According%20to%20C%26R%20Research%2C%20an,a%20month%20on%20subscription%20services). Include recurring_merchants counts and amounts. Simulate common subscription services (streaming, phone, gym, software) and utilities (electric, internet, insurance).
- **Transaction details:** Include date, amount, merchant name/ID, and payment method (credit card, debit, ACH, cash). If using Plaid-like data, include fields like payment_channel (online, in-person) and currency (USD). Tag transactions by category (primary and detailed) so spending patterns are clear (e.g. "Entertainment: TV/Streaming").
- **Cash flow signals:** Record any interest or fees (credit card interest, bank fees), minimum payments, and overdue flags. Also track savings/investment flows (e.g. transfers to savings accounts) to compute metrics like "savings_growth_rate" and "net_savings_inflow".

## Population Distribution & Subpopulations

Weight and segment users to match national demographics while allowing specific subgroups. We should align aggregate stats with U.S. totals[\[10\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04380-7?error=cookies_not_supported&code=2eb2eca4-2c02-428e-8076-90d386a4e861#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%20we%20describe,United%20States%2C%20using%20only%20publicly)[\[4\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#age#:~:text=%2443%2C313%20%C2%B1%2491%20Per%20capita%20income), but also simulate particular cohorts. Suggestions:

- **National weights:** Draw synthetic households so totals (by age, income, race, region) match U.S. census distributions[\[10\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04380-7?error=cookies_not_supported&code=2eb2eca4-2c02-428e-8076-90d386a4e861#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%20we%20describe,United%20States%2C%20using%20only%20publicly)[\[3\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#:~:text=131%2C332%2C360%20%C2%B1130%2C190%20Number%20of%20households). For example, use ACS joint distributions of income×household size, and race×age[\[10\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04380-7?error=cookies_not_supported&code=2eb2eca4-2c02-428e-8076-90d386a4e861#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%20we%20describe,United%20States%2C%20using%20only%20publicly). This ensures overall representativeness (e.g. number of low-income vs. high-income, urban vs. rural households as in census).
- **Specific subpopulations:** Oversample or explicitly simulate groups of interest. This could include segments like rural residents, urban dwellers, single parents, students, retirees, or various racial/ethnic communities. Each group may have distinct spending and income profiles (e.g. younger people may spend more on entertainment and less on healthcare). For each subgroup, align key metrics (median income, age, spending mix) with reported values from sources like the ACS or Census.
- **Persona overflow ("General" users):** Not all users fit a narrow persona. Include a broad "general wellness" group for the majority, with average utilization (<50% credit usage), modest recurring spend, and steady income. These default users should follow typical budget patterns (e.g. ~50/30/20 budgeting rule) and moderate credit usage.
- **Urban/rural & regional:** Even at a national level, consider broad geography: e.g. include users from Northeast, South, Midwest, West in roughly census proportions. Different regions have different income and cost-of-living norms.
- **Other factors:** Include foreign-born vs. native proportions (~14% foreign-born[\[11\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#:~:text=Place%20of%20birth)), and education levels (nearly 90% high-school grads[\[12\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#:~:text=Educational%20attainment)). These factors indirectly affect finances (e.g. education correlates with income).

In summary, enrich the synthetic dataset with U.S. population parameters: age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, household composition, and location[\[10\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04380-7?error=cookies_not_supported&code=2eb2eca4-2c02-428e-8076-90d386a4e861#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%20we%20describe,United%20States%2C%20using%20only%20publicly)[\[4\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#age#:~:text=%2443%2C313%20%C2%B1%2491%20Per%20capita%20income). Likewise, model transactions across realistic categories and timing. This ensures users and their spending mirror real national patterns (e.g. housing 33% of spend, subscription ~\$219/month[\[8\]](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cesan.pdf#:~:text=aggregate%20of%20the%20five%20smallest,0%20percent%20of%20total%20expenditures)[\[9\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/experts-suggest-taking-stock-of-how-much-your-monthly-subscriptions-really-cost-before-the-end-of-the-year/#:~:text=According%20to%20C%26R%20Research%2C%20an,a%20month%20on%20subscription%20services)) and that all subgroups (not just the five personas) are represented.

**Sources:** Census and ACS data provide demographic baselines (e.g. median age 39.2, household size 2.5[\[13\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#age#:~:text=39)[\[3\]](http://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/#:~:text=131%2C332%2C360%20%C2%B1130%2C190%20Number%20of%20households)) and expenditure breakdowns[\[8\]](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cesan.pdf#:~:text=aggregate%20of%20the%20five%20smallest,0%20percent%20of%20total%20expenditures)[\[9\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/experts-suggest-taking-stock-of-how-much-your-monthly-subscriptions-really-cost-before-the-end-of-the-year/#:~:text=According%20to%20C%26R%20Research%2C%20an,a%20month%20on%20subscription%20services). Synthetic-population research recommends including household income, size, race, age, sex, etc.[\[10\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04380-7?error=cookies_not_supported&code=2eb2eca4-2c02-428e-8076-90d386a4e861#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%20we%20describe,United%20States%2C%20using%20only%20publicly)[\[14\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04380-7?error=cookies_not_supported&code=2eb2eca4-2c02-428e-8076-90d386a4e861#:~:text=The%20data%20from%20the%20census,5%29%20ethnicity) to match U.S. totals.
